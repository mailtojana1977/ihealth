    "content": "In South Korea, medical devices are regulated by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), which governs the manufacture, importation, distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices under the Medical Device Act. Compliance with MFDS requirements is mandatory to ensure that a medical device is legally placed on and maintained in the South Korean market. For procurement activities, devices must be sourced through a duly authorized Korean License Holder (KLH), as foreign manufacturers or suppliers cannot directly sell medical devices in South Korea without a locally licensed entity. The KLH acts as the legal representative responsible for regulatory compliance, market authorization, and post-market obligations."
